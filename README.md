Saloon Items Vendor

=================================================

Installation :

1 - ensure vorp_vendor

2 - add vorp_vendor to resources folder

At the begining I thought about a booze vendor for the Saloons because I was playing with Poke's Licor Effects script but I think it will be useful to sell anything you want, I got all the saloons location and example items are stored in config.lua, you can add more locations (an owned house for example) or items to buy if you want to (more food, etc.)

I did an English version just rename en.lua to config.lua

=================================================

This is heavily based on the beautiful Nerakhon's and Blue's bwrp_animalshelter script menu and location system, I added all the Saloons locations and options to buy stuff there, I plan to add blips for the Saloons as soon as I learn how to do it reliably

Very funny if u install Poke's Licor script too :)
